# Nearley Syntax Highlighting for Sublime Text

This repository provides a Sublime Text syntax highlighting file for Nearley, a simple, fast, and powerful parsing toolkit. The `Nearley.sublime-syntax` file enables Sublime Text to recognize and highlight the syntax of Nearley grammar files (`*.ne`) effectively.

## Purpose

The purpose of this syntax highlighting file is to enhance the readability and editability of Nearley grammar files by providing clear, context-aware highlighting rules tailored specifically for Nearley syntax and embedded JavaScript code.

## Installation Instructions

To install the Nearley syntax highlighting for Sublime Text on macOS, follow these steps:

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**
   - If you have git installed, you can clone this repository directly into your Sublime Text Packages directory using the following command:
     ```bash
     cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text/Packages/
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nearley-syntax-highlighting.git Nearley
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can download the ZIP file of this repository, extract it, and move the contents to the appropriate directory.

2. **Manual Installation**
   - If you prefer to install the syntax file manually, navigate to the following directory:
     ```
     ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text/Packages/
     ```
   - Create a new folder named `Nearley` if it doesn't already exist.
   - Copy the `Nearley.sublime-syntax` file into the `Nearley` folder.

3. **Activating the Syntax**
   - Restart Sublime Text after installing the syntax file.
   - Open a Nearley grammar file (with the `.ne` extension).
   - Sublime Text should automatically detect and apply the Nearley syntax highlighting. If it does not, you can manually select it from the bottom right corner of the window by clicking on the current syntax name (e.g., "Plain Text") and selecting `Nearley` from the list.
